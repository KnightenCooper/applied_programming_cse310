# Overview

This program will display the words "Hello World"

I am making this program to practice outputting text using python and practice using GitHub to further my skills as a software developer.

I have provided a YouTube link to a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code as my IDE for this software.

This program was made using Python.
